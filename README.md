# Code_weighted_multiplex_ensembles
This repository contains:

1) 'code_entropy_duplex.m' a Matlab function for the computation of the entropy value and the related Lagrangian multipliers for a canonical duplex ensemble with given expected multidegree and multistrength.

2) 'main_single_instance.m' a Matlab script for the generation of a new duplex. It requires as INPUT, Z,T01, T10, T11, D01b, D10a, D11a, D11b, matrices that are the results of 'code_entropy_duplex.m'. This script calls the function 'duplexsingleinstance.m'

3) 'duplexsingleinstance.m',  see the script "main_single_instance.m" for explanations
